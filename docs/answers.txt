How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)

Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository (4 points)
Addng features or for a team of devs working on the same repo.  This minimizes conflicts in the main branch.
What is the difference between git log and git status? (4 points)
git log is to check history and git status shows the current state of the repo.
What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files? (4 points)
git log -- Vehicle.h
What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”? (4 points)
git log --grep="file"
In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
Inheritance allows reuse of public or protect functions from the parent class in any child class.
Polymorphism allows access to different object types all in the same interface.
Encapsulation restrict access to direct varibles by using setter and getter methods

9.  What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow? (5 points)
    How the changes are made on the repository.  Integration manager over sees all merges to main repo from a devs branch. A dictator and Lieutenants has a dev push to a lieutenant repo, which acts as a helper to dictatorto handle merge conflicts dictator pushs to main.
10. How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? (5 points)
    Dictator and Lieutenants works best for large teams due to its ability to maintain a smooth workflow by having Lieutenants manage different sections of the projects.  Having 100 devs manage their own pulling and pushing could create conflicts and confusion in the main repo
